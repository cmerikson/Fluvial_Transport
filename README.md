# Fluvial Transport

This app calculates the transport distance along a stream.
It is designed for tracking RFID tracers across multiple survey dates.

It works by assigning a location along the stream centerline for each tracer on each date. Then the distance between locations is calculated for each tracer between all dates.
A total distance traveled is also calculated.
